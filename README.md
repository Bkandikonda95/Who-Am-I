Hello, I'm Bharath Kandikonda, a versatile professional currently enhancing my career path in Data Science and Analytics. Currently, I'm pursuing my master of science in Computer and Information systems at Southern Arkansas University, and with over five years of experience as a Data Analyst, I have a strong background in data analysis, visualization, and reporting. 

My most recent role was at Virtusa, where I delivered insights and solutions for various clients and projects, using SQL, Python, Tableau, and Power BI. I have experience in designing, developing, and maintaining data pipelines for various data sources and integrating them with analytical tools for data visualization and reporting purposes.

I am passionate about finding patterns and trends in data, and using them to optimize processes, improve performance, and enhance decision-making. I collaborated with other data professionals and stakeholders and leveraged my data expertise to create value and impact for the organizations and communities I served. 

I am always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies, and I also have certifications in Looker Studio & SQL for Data Analysis. In addition to my technical skills, I possess excellent communication and collaboration skills, which have allowed me to work effectively in cross-functional teams.

I am seeking new opportunities to apply my data skills and knowledge and contribute to meaningful and challenging projects that align with my values and goals.
